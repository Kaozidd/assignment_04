			<h2>Life is a sport. Make it count.</h2>
			<p>Two years ago, Nike came to us to realize en idea: a 
			device that tracks your daily activity and a common, 
			universal metric called Fuel for every active body out 
			there. They asked us to design the entire user 
			experience. We ensured ease of use: set your goal, 
			and get from red to green. If you meet you goal, 
			animations celebrate your performance. Hit a streak 
			and Fuelie shows up to cheer you on. Data 
			visualizations show where you were most active 
			daily, weekly, monthly, and beyond. We created
			Bluetooth synch technology so when you finish your 
			day, your Fuel is wireless synced to the platform. 
			NikeFuel levels the playing field, and fits into 
			your life. #Counts
